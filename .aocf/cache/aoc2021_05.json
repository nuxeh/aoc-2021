    "first": "\\--- Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture ---\n----------\n\nYou come across a field of [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent) on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.\n\nThey tend to form in *lines*; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review. For example:\n\n```\n0,9 -> 5,9\n8,0 -> 0,8\n9,4 -> 3,4\n2,2 -> 2,1\n7,0 -> 7,4\n6,4 -> 2,0\n0,9 -> 2,9\n3,4 -> 1,4\n0,0 -> 8,8\n5,5 -> 8,2\n\n```\n\nEach line of vents is given as a line segment in the format `x1,y1 -> x2,y2` where `x1`,`y1` are the coordinates of one end the line segment and `x2`,`y2` are the coordinates of the other end. These line segments include the points at both ends. In other words:\n\n* An entry like `1,1 -> 1,3` covers points `1,1`, `1,2`, and `1,3`.\n* An entry like `9,7 -> 7,7` covers points `9,7`, `8,7`, and `7,7`.\n\nFor now, *only consider horizontal and vertical lines*: lines where either `x1 = x2` or `y1 = y2`.\n\nSo, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce the following diagram:\n\n```\n.......1..\n..1....1..\n..1....1..\n.......1..\n.112111211\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n222111....\n\n```\n\nIn this diagram, the top left corner is `0,0` and the bottom right corner is `9,9`. Each position is shown as *the number of lines which cover that point* or `.` if no line covers that point. The top-left pair of `1`s, for example, comes from `2,2 -> 2,1`; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines `0,9 -> 5,9` and `0,9 -> 2,9`.\n\nTo avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine *the number of points where at least two lines overlap*. In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a `2` or larger - a total of `*5*` points.\n\nConsider only horizontal and vertical lines. *At how many points do at least two lines overlap?*\n\nYour puzzle answer was `4421`.\n\nThe first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: \\*\n\n\\--- Part Two ---\n----------\n\nUnfortunately, considering only horizontal and vertical lines doesn't give you the full picture; you need to also consider *diagonal lines*.\n\nBecause of the limits of the hydrothermal vent mapping system, the lines in your list will only ever be horizontal, vertical, or a diagonal line at exactly 45 degrees. In other words:\n\n* An entry like `1,1 -> 3,3` covers points `1,1`, `2,2`, and `3,3`.\n* An entry like `9,7 -> 7,9` covers points `9,7`, `8,8`, and `7,9`.\n\nConsidering all lines from the above example would now produce the following diagram:\n\n```\n1.1....11.\n.111...2..\n..2.1.111.\n...1.2.2..\n.112313211\n...1.2....\n..1...1...\n.1.....1..\n1.......1.\n222111....\n\n```\n\nYou still need to determine *the number of points where at least two lines overlap*. In the above example, this is still anywhere in the diagram with a `2` or larger - now a total of `*12*` points.\n\nConsider all of the lines. *At how many points do at least two lines overlap?*\n\nAnswer:\n\nAlthough it hasn't changed, you can still [get your puzzle input](5/input).",
